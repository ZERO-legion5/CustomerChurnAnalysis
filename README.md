# Project Overview
This project involves the development and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for image classification tasks. The model has been trained on a specific dataset and achieved an accuracy of 85.8%. This README provides an overview of the model, its architecture, and how to use it.

# Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and fully connected layers leading to the output layer. The architecture was fine-tuned to achieve the best balance between complexity and performance, resulting in an accuracy of 85.8%.
